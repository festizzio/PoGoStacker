open: Sets connection to the connection string and loads everything into the GUI
close: closes all SQL connections

	just loop through all the names in the CURRENT_AND_LEGACY_REWARDS_LIST, pull them from the full list, and put them in researchRewards.
writeToStack: Writes to stack SQL table the new Pokemon that was just claimed
addReward: Called from the controller classes, adds the reward and calls writeToStack
